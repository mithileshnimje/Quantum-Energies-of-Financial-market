Market noise is chaos; structure is physics. This repository hosts the research and implementation of the Quantum Energy Model—a system that uses Newtonian Inertia and Impact Theory to turn the Supertrend into a predictive energy detector. 

Executive Summary

The Quantum Energy (QE) Framework is a rigorous mathematical model that translates financial market structure into a physical coordinate system. While traditional technical analysis relies on subjective pattern recognition, the QE Framework utilizes Kinematic Derivatives (Velocity and Acceleration) to identify discrete energy states within the "Leader" (Supertrend).

This repository documents the transition from Inertia (stagnant structure) to Force-Release Events (structural breaks), quantifying the exact moment where "Heavy Mass" transactions transform into Residual Energy.
